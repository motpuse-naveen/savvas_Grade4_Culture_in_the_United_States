                    <p>This text set includes four informational texts and an interactive map. All focus on an aspect of
                        culture and the way culture shapes our lives.</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">What Is Culture?</span> is the anchor text for this set. Depending on the
                        needs of your class, you may choose to assign <span class="bold">What Is Culture?</span> for
                        independent reading, or you may choose to read it aloud with the class. Beginning with the
                        anchor text will ground students in concepts and academic vocabulary that are key to discussing
                        the Big Question. As students read the other texts in the set, they will compare their new
                        understandings, as well as the structure and features of the text, with the anchor text.</p>
                    <p>After students read the anchor text, you may choose to assign specific texts or encourage
                        students to choose the texts that appeal to them the most. Use the chart below to see where
                        specific text features, text structures, and content topics appear across the texts in this set.

                            Culture?</i>
                        Ask: <span class="blue_scripting">What would you like to learn about culture? What ideas do you
                            have about what culture is?</span></p>

                        word with the class.
                        Ask: <span class="blue_scripting"> Have you heard people talk about their <i><span
                                    class="bold">culture?</span></i> What were

                            special foods you eat? Can you give an example of a <i><span class="bold">belief</span></i>
                            that you or someone you know

                        students become familiar with them. For example: <span class="blue_scripting">When you influence
                            someone, you have an effect on them. Who are some people who <span
                                class="bold">influence</span> your decisions? When
                            you <span class="bold">adapt</span> to something, you get used to it. Have you ever needed
                            to <span class="bold">adapt</span> to a new

                        and an example. Say: <span class="blue_scripting">How would you define <span

                            sentence? What is a synonym for <span class="bold">culture?</span> What is an example of a
                            culture?</span> Tell students to create a four-square for culture on a sheet of paper. A

                    <p>Remind students of the Big Question: What can we learn
                        from observing the night sky? Ask: <span class="blue_scripting">How do you think Through a

                        planet. Discuss the meaning of each word with the class.</p>
                    <p>Ask: <span class="blue_scripting">What can you see when you look up at the night sky? Can you see
                            the moon? Can you see any planets? Have you ever used a <span class="bold">telescope</span>
                            to see far away things?</span></p>

                        new or challenging for students. During class discussions, use these new terms repeatedly to
                        help students become familiar with them. For example: <span class="blue_scripting">When we <span

                    <p>Share a Word Web graphic organizer. To help students think about the relationships between words,
                        guide them in creating a word web using the word <i>telescope</i>. When they read <i>Through a
                            Telescope</i>, encourage them to add words to their web that relate to the word
                        <i>telescope</i>. A web for <i>telescope</i> might look like this:
                    </p>
                    <p>[a word web with <i>telescope</i> in the center, and with <i>moon, Saturn, planets, stars,</i>

                        using all the information they now have from their reading. For example, students might connect
                        the words <i>crescent, full moon, gibbous, phase,</i> and <i>moon</i>, as they're all related to
                        phases of the
                        moon.</p>
                    <p>Ask students to share their word sorts and explain why they connected the words the way they did.
                        Students may sort words based on their own experiences, so accept all reasonable explanations

                    <p>An important part of building a vibrant classroom culture is creating an atmosphere in which all
                        students feel empowered to participate in powerful classroom conversation. You may have noticed
                        that
                        your students who are naturally extroverted often participate freely in a whole-class
                        discussion,
                        while those who are more introverted or, perhaps, who come from cultures that respect different
                        classroom norms, may need encouragement to share. You can use sentence prompts like these to
                        invite
                        all students into the conversation:</p>
                    <p>“That’s so interesting … please tell me more!”</p>
                    <p>“Can someone explain that in a different way?”</p>
                    <p>“What are some examples of that?”</p>
                    <p>“Can someone add on to that idea?”</p>
                    <p>Sharing and discussing ideas will often involve agreeing and/or disagreeing with what others say.
                        As
                        students listen carefully and respond thoughtfully to their classmates’ ideas, encourage them to
                        express themselves in respectful and constructive ways. You may wish to post these sentence
                        starters
                        prominently, so students can refer to them often:</p>
                    <p>“I agree, and I also think <span class="sr-only">fill in the blank line</span><span
                            class="solidl">__________</span> .”</p>
                    <p>“I mostly agree, but <span class="sr-only">fill in the blank line</span><span
                            class="solidl">__________</span> .”</p>
                    <p>“I like what you just said because <span class="sr-only">fill in the blank line</span><span
                            class="solidl">__________</span> .”</p>
                    <p>“I respectfully disagree because <span class="sr-only">fill in the blank line</span><span
                            class="solidl">__________</span> .”</p>
